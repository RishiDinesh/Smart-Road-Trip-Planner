I would have to say that this is arguably the best hotel in Chennai at the moment and if you can spar few extra bucks upgrade to the sea view rooms to indulge in a get away that will leave you with fond memories. \n\nMy family thoroughly enjoyed their stay and can't wait to be back. The rooms are well appointed and the level of service is what makes Sheraton stand out compared to other peroperties......",

Helpful staff. \r\nI am a Marriott Pt member who got upgraded and was given freebies, which I am thankful for. This is my first negative review about a Marriott property.\r\nFour reasons for disappointment : \r\n1. :Sunday brunch : After the lunch was mostly laid out, the food display area floor and an in-floor gutter were being cleaned, creating a foul stench and health risk! The chef was very nonchalant about it!\r\n2. The light switches in my suite took a PhD to learn to operate, an 'engineer' sent to help could turn off one light only by cutting the wire to it and asked me to sleep with the other light on. \r\n3. It is a pain to find the way to the Garden Level rooms. The one small elevator to service that floor has cleaning carts parked to it.\r\n4. New Year Eve dinner buffet was late by 1.5 hours, the New Years Day buffet by on hour.",
